## PIPO - Maya version

By Quazar


A pipeline manager running in Autodesk Maya, allowing
you to work on your projects with a number of 
architecture / nomenclature customization possibilities


> [!CAUTION]
> The development of this project is no longer in progress, and has given way to the creation of PIPO Standalone, a new pipeline manager capable of communicating with maya while operating independently of it.
>In parallel, a program to optimize a folder architecture within a pipeline to avoid performance nodes is currently in preparation and will probably be merged with Pipo Standalone.
